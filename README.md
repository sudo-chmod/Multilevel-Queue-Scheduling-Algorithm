Assignment 8 - Multilevel Queue Scheduling


Write a program to simulate a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm with 4 queues. Each queue must be assigned a priority, with q0 having the highest priority and q3 having the lowest priority. The following scheduling algorithms should be used for each queue:

● q0 - Round Robin (RR)
● q1 - Shortest Job First (SJF)
● q2 - Shortest Job First (SJF)
● q3 - First-In-First-Out (FIFO)

Each queue should be given a time quantum of 20 seconds, and the CPU should switch between queues after every 20 seconds. The user should be prompted to enter the number of processes along with their priority associated with each queue.

Task:
1. Implement the scheduling algorithm in a programming language of your choice.
2. Test the program with different numbers of processes and different priorities.
3. Analyze the results and compare the performance of each scheduling algorithm using following criteria.
    a. Waiting time
    b. Turnaround time
